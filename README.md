## Day 10 Final Project - 100 Days of Python 

### Simple Calculator

This program is a simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division at the moment. It was made in correlaton with the 100 days of code course linked below, so it lacks heavy validation to keep in line. 

In the future I plan on adding more advanced functionality, but as of now it allows endless calculation chaining as well as basic recursion to allow restarting from the beginning.
